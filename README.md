## Contribution
    This app was made possible with the help of my instructors and tutors.
    I used code from Section 13 - ORM activities: 6, 8, 12, 14, 28. 
    I received additonal help from tutor Jili Jiang. 
    Jili helped with fixing routes and correcting syntax errors along with running insomnia.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) was my main reference for code syntax.  

## Test
    There is no current Test function.
